# Simple Demonstration of a Symbolic System Structure

In this tutorial we will show how to implement a system structure type for defining the
symbolic indexing of a domain-specific language. This tutorial will show how the
`SymbolCache` type is defined to take in arrays of symbols for its independent, dependent,
and parameter variable names and uses that to define the symbolic indexing interface.
